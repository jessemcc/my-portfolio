I have a passion for designing and developing websites and applications that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing. With four years of prior experience in web design, I am a self-taught coder who has honed my skills through online courses from freecodecamp and codecademy.\n\nI am a firm believer in the power of continuous learning and growth, which is why I spend my free time practicing with leetcode and building websites. I am constantly striving to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the field of software engineering.\n\nBeyond my professional life, I have a variety of hobbies and interests that keep me engaged and energized. I am an avid movie and TV show buff and love to spend my downtime catching up on the latest releases. I am also a big fan of board games like Catan, chess, Go, and Risk, and enjoy playing video games like XCOM, Elden Ring, and NHL.\n\nBefore becoming a software engineer, I worked in customer service, first as a security guard for the US Embassy, and later as a supervisor for Subway. These experiences taught me the importance of communication, problem-solving, and attention to detail, all of which have proven to be invaluable skills in my current role.\n\nI am passionate about creating intuitive, user-friendly, and efficient web applications that meet the needs of my clients and users. I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow in my field, and am excited about what the future holds for me as a software engineer.")',
